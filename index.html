		<b>Hartmut Kaiser</b><br>

    <details>
      <summary style="color:blue;">Abstract</summary>
      <p>With the advent of modern computer architectures characterized by -- amongst other things -- many-core nodes, deep and complex memory hierarchies, heterogeneous subsystems, and power-aware components, it is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve best possible application scalability and satisfactory parallel efficiency. The community is experimenting with new programming models that rely on finer-grain parallelism, and flexible and lightweight synchronization, combined with work-queue-based, message-driven computation. The recently growing interest in the C++ programming language in industry and in the wider community increases the demand for libraries implementing those programming models for the language.</p><p>
      In this talk, we present a new asynchronous C++ parallel programming model that is built around lightweight tasks and mechanisms to orchestrate massively parallel (and -- if needed -- distributed) execution. This model uses the concept of (Standard C++) futures to make data dependencies explicit, employs explicit and implicit asynchrony to hide latencies and to improve utilization, and manages finer-grain parallelism with a work-stealing scheduling system enabling automatic load balancing of tasks.</p>

		<b>Muthu Baskaran</b>
		Reservoir Labs, Inc.
    <details>
      <summary style="color:blue;">Abstract</summary>
      <p>Asynchronous task-based programming has become a popular parallel programming model, offering advantages such as better extraction of available parallelism, dynamic load balancing, and improved scalability. For productivity, performance, and code sustainability reasons, there is an increasing demand for auto-parallelizing and optimizing compilers to generate code using task-based models. In this talk, we present our work that delivers an end-to-end path for optimization and code generation for asynchronous task-based systems using R-Stream, an auto-parallelizing polyhedral compiler. We also discuss the key aspects of our compiler to generate task-based parallelism and data management for a broader class of task-based runtimes that includes (but not limited to) Legion, Kokkos, OpenMP, and PaRSEC. We give an overview of the benefits of our compiler support that provides improved developer productivity and application performance.

          CnC is a parallel programming model for mainstream programmers
          that philosophically differs from other approaches.
          CnC programmers do not specify parallel operations. Instead,
          they only specify semantic ordering constraints. This provides
          a separation of concerns between the domain expert and tuning expert,
          simplifying the domain expert’s job while providing more flexibility
          to the tuning expert. Details on CnC and related research can be
          found at:

          Prior workshops have served as a forum for users and potential
            users of Concurrent Collections (CnC), to discuss experiences
            with CnC and a range of topics, including developments for the
            language, applications, usability, performance, semantics, and
            teaching of CnC.
